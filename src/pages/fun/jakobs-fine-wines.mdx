title: "Jakob's Fine Wines - a demo of the View Transition API"
---

The first time I saw [this demo](https://live-transitions.pages.dev/), I was completely blown away, and I knew I wanted to check out the thing that made it possible - the [view transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API). Fast-forward about a year after I initially discovered it, and I've had a lightning talk accepted at Booster conf in Bergen to talk about preciesly this.

I used this as motivation to make a cool demo, similar to the one that inspired me, though instead of Astro it just uses pure HTML and CSS! If you're using a browser that supports the view transition API (ie. not Firefox), give it a look:

If you wanna see what the code looks like, it's of course available [on GitHub](https://github.com/itzjacki/view-transitions-wine-shop)!

## Why an online wine store?

I figured that a mock-webstore would be a good choice for the demo, and I am a big wine nerd who happened to own a domain comprised of my own name and the Norwegian word for wine already üç∑.
