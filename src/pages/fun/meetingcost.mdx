title: "The story behind my only São Toméan domain name"
---

I think a lot of people in IT would say they have too many meetings, while very few would say the opposite. While I definitely appreciate the value of talking to the people you're making stuff with (something that might require a meeting), I definitely fit in the first group - I think we have too many, often totally unnecessary meetings.

I'm also pretty sure that a major reason for why this happens is that people don't understand just how expensive meetings really are. If they had to sign off on an expense equivalent to the total time spent every time they called people into a meeting, I think we would have less useless ones.

During a particularly dark period (which thankfully is over now) at work we had regular 4-hour (!) 120-person (!!!) meetings. Or in other words, meetings with absolutely astronomically high costs. During that one of these meetings I decided to become the proud owner of my first São Toméan domain name, [meetingco.st](https://meetingco.st).

I've finally taken the time to realize my silly little idea for that website. If it stops even one stupid-ass multi-hour multi-person meeting in the future I will consider my time and money well spent.
